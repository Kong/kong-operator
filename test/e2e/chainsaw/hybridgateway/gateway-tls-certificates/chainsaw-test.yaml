# Gateway TLS certificates test scenario.
apiVersion: chainsaw.kyverno.io/v1alpha1
kind: Test
metadata:
  name: gateway-tls-certificates
spec:
  description: |
    This test validates that the hybrid gateway controller correctly
    processes Gateway TLS listeners and creates KongCertificate and KongSNI
    resources from the referenced TLS secrets.
