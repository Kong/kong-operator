// CalculateEndpointWeights translates a set of service-level weights into the
// smallest possible integer weights for their individual endpoints. This is a crucial
// step for data plane components that need a flat list of weighted
// endpoints to perform traffic splitting.
//
// The core logic ensures that the proportion of traffic sent to each service's
// group of endpoints perfectly matches the original service-level weight distribution.
//
// --- Mathematical Logic ---
//
//  1. Calculate Traffic-per-Endpoint Ratio: For each backend service, the conceptual
//     share of traffic for a single endpoint is proportional to its (ServiceWeight / NumberOfEndpoints).
//     For example, a service with weight 80 and 10 endpoints has a per-endpoint "value" of 8,
//     while a service with weight 100 and 20 endpoints has a per-endpoint "value" of 5.
//
//  2. Convert Ratios to Integers: Since the dataplane requires integer weights, we must
//     convert these fractional ratios into a set of whole numbers that maintain the
//     exact same proportions.
//     - First, each fraction (W/E) is simplified to its lowest terms by dividing
//     the numerator and denominator by their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).
//     - Then, we find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all the denominators from the
//     simplified fractions. This LCM is the smallest number that can be used as a
//     common multiplier to turn all the fractions into integers.
//
//  3. Simplify to Smallest Integers: The resulting integer weights are mathematically
//     correct but might be unnecessarily large (e.g., 300 and 400). To ensure maximum
//     efficiency in the data plane, we simplify them.
//     - We calculate the GCD of this new set of integer weights.
//     - By dividing each weight by this GCD, we arrive at the smallest possible
//     set of integers that preserve the original traffic distribution (e.g., 3 and 4).
//
// --- Edge Cases Handled ---
//
//   - A backend with 0 weight or 0 endpoints is correctly assigned an effective endpoint weight of 0.
//   - This gracefully handles the case where a service has weight > 0 but no ready endpoints.
//   - Overflow Protection: All arithmetic operations are protected against uint32 overflow.
//     If calculations would exceed uint32 limits, values are capped at the maximum, ensuring
//     the algorithm remains stable even with extreme configurations.
//
// --- Example 1: Basic Case ---
//
// - Backend A: {Weight: 3, Endpoints: 10} -> Ratio: 3/10
// - Backend B: {Weight: 8, Endpoints: 20} -> Ratio: 8/20 (simplifies to 2/5)
//
// 1. Fractions are 3/10 and 2/5. Denominators are 10 and 5.
// 2. LCM(10, 5) = 10.
// 3. Multiply each fraction by the LCM:
//   - A: (3/10) * 10 = 3
//   - B: (2/5)  * 10 = 4
//     4. Unsimplified weights are {3, 4}. GCD(3, 4) = 1.
//     5. Final weights are {3, 4}. This means each of A's 10 endpoints gets weight 3,
//     and each of B's 20 endpoints gets weight 4.
//
// --- Example 2: Complex Case ---
//
// - Backend V1: {Weight: 50, Endpoints: 5} -> Ratio: 50/5 (simplifies to 10/1)
// - Backend V2: {Weight: 50, Endpoints: 8} -> Ratio: 50/8 (simplifies to 25/4)
// - Backend V3: {Weight:  1, Endpoints: 1} -> Ratio: 1/1
//
// 1. Fractions are 10/1, 25/4, and 1/1. Denominators are 1, 4, 1.
// 2. LCM(1, 4, 1) = 4.
// 3. Multiply each fraction by the LCM:
//   - V1: (10/1) * 4 = 40
//   - V2: (25/4) * 4 = 25
//   - V3: (1/1)  * 4 = 4
//
// 4. Unsimplified weights are {40, 25, 4}. GCD(40, 25, 4) = 1.
// 5. Final weights are {40, 25, 4}.
