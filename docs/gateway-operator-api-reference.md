### AIGateway


AIGateway is a network Gateway enabling access and management for AI &
Machine Learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM).<br /><br />The underlying technology for the AIGateway is the Kong Gateway configured
with a variety of plugins which provide the the AI featureset.<br /><br />This is a list of the plugins, which are available in Kong Gateway v3.6.x+:<br /><br />  - ai-proxy (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-proxy)
  - ai-request-transformer (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-request-transformer)
  - ai-response-transformers (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-response-transformer)
  - ai-prompt-template (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-template)
  - ai-prompt-guard-plugin (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-guard)
  - ai-prompt-decorator-plugin (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-decorator)<br /><br />So effectively the AIGateway resource provides a bespoke Gateway resource
(which it owns and manages) with the gateway, consumers and plugin
configurations automated and configurable via Kubernetes APIs.<br /><br />The current iteration only supports the proxy itself, but the API is being
built with room for future growth in several dimensions. For instance:<br /><br />  - Supporting auxiliary functions (e.g. decorator, guard, templater, token-rate-limit)
  - Supporting request/response transformers
  - Supporting more than just LLMs (e.g. CCNs, GANs, e.t.c.)
  - Supporting more hosting options for LLMs (e.g. self hosted)
  - Supporting more AI cloud providers
  - Supporting more AI cloud provider features<br /><br />The validation rules throughout are set up to ensure at least one
cloud-provider-based LLM is specified, but in the future when we have more
model types and more hosting options for those types so we may want to look
into using CEL validation to ensure that at least one model configuration is
provided. We may also want to use CEL to validate things like identifier
unique-ness, e.t.c.<br /><br />See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `gatewayClassName` _string_ | GatewayClassName is the name of the GatewayClass which is responsible for the AIGateway. |
| `largeLanguageModels` _[LargeLanguageModels](#largelanguagemodels)_ | LargeLanguageModels is a list of Large Language Models (LLMs) to be managed by the AI Gateway.<br /><br />This is a required field because we only support LLMs at the moment. In future iterations we may support other model types. |

| `identifier` _string_ | Identifier is the unique name which identifies the LLM. This will be used as part of the requests made to an AIGateway endpoint. For instance: if you provided the identifier "devteam-gpt-access", then you would access this model via "https://${endpoint}/devteam-gpt-access" and supply it with your consumer credentials to authenticate requests. |
| `model` _string_ | Model is the model name of the LLM (e.g. gpt-3.5-turbo, phi-2, e.t.c.).<br /><br />If not specified, whatever the cloud provider specifies as the default model will be used. |
| `promptType` _[LLMPromptType](#llmprompttype)_ | PromptType is the type of prompt to be used for inference requests to the LLM (e.g. "chat", "completions").<br /><br />If "chat" is specified, prompts sent by the user will be interactive, contextual and stateful. The LLM will dynamically answer questions and simulate a dialogue, while also keeping track of the conversation to provide contextually relevant responses.<br /><br />If "completions" is specified, prompts sent by the user will be stateless and "one-shot". The LLM will provide a single response to the prompt, without any context from previous prompts.<br /><br />If not specified, "completions" will be used as the default. |
| `defaultPrompts` _[LLMPrompt](#llmprompt) array_ | DefaultPrompts is a list of prompts that should be provided to the LLM by default. This is generally used to influence inference behavior, for instance by providing a "system" role prompt that instructs the LLM to take on a certain persona. |

_Appears in:_
- [KongPluginInstallation](#kongplugininstallation)



#### LLMPrompt


LLMPrompt is a text prompt that includes parameters, a role and content.<br /><br />This is intended for situations like when you need to provide roles in a
prompt to an LLM in order to influence its behavior and responses.<br /><br />For example, you might want to provide a "system" role and tell the LLM
something like "you are a helpful assistant who responds in the style of
Sherlock Holmes".



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `content` _string_ | Content is the prompt text sent for inference. |
| `role` _[LLMPromptRole](#llmpromptrole)_ | Role indicates the role of the prompt. This is used to identify the prompt's purpose, such as "system" or "user" and can influence the behavior of the LLM.<br /><br />If not specified, "user" will be used as the default. |


_Appears in:_
- [CloudHostedLargeLanguageModel](#cloudhostedlargelanguagemodel)

#### LLMPromptParams


LLMPromptParams contains parameters that can be used to control the behavior
of a large language model (LLM) when generating text based on a prompt.



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `temperature` _string_ | Temperature controls the randomness of predictions by scaling the logits before applying softmax. A lower temperature (e.g., 0.0 to 0.7) makes the model more confident in its predictions, leading to more repetitive and deterministic outputs. A higher temperature (e.g., 0.8 to 1.0) increases randomness, generating more diverse and creative outputs. At very high temperatures, the outputs may become nonsensical or highly unpredictable. |
| `maxTokens` _integer_ | Max Tokens specifies the maximum length of the model's output in terms of the number of tokens (words or pieces of words). This parameter limits the output's size, ensuring the model generates content within a manageable scope. A token can be a word or part of a word, depending on the model's tokenizer. |
| `topK` _integer_ | TopK sampling is a technique where the model's prediction is limited to the K most likely next tokens at each step of the generation process. The probability distribution is truncated to these top K tokens, and the next token is randomly sampled from this subset. This method helps in reducing the chance of selecting highly improbable tokens, making the text more coherent. A smaller K leads to more predictable text, while a larger K allows for more diversity but with an increased risk of incoherence. |
| `topP` _string_ | TopP (also known as nucleus sampling) is an alternative to top K sampling. Instead of selecting the top K tokens, top P sampling chooses from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold P. This method dynamically adjusts the number of tokens considered at each step, depending on their probability distribution. It helps in maintaining diversity while also avoiding very unlikely tokens. A higher P value increases diversity but can lead to less coherence, whereas a lower P value makes the model's outputs more focused and coherent. |

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ports` _[DataPlaneServicePort](#dataplaneserviceport) array_ | Ports defines the list of ports that are exposed by the service. The ports field allows defining the name, port and targetPort of the underlying service ports, while the protocol is defaulted to TCP, as it is the only protocol currently supported. |
| `type` _[ServiceType](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#servicetype-v1-core)_ | Type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to `LoadBalancer`.<br /><br />`ClusterIP` allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.<br /><br />`NodePort` exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address, the same as if you had requested a Service of type: ClusterIP.<br /><br />`LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types |
| `name` _string_ | Name defines the name of the service. If Name is empty, the controller will generate a service name from the owning object. |
| `annotations` _object (keys:string, values:string)_ | Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.<br /><br />More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations |
| `externalTrafficPolicy` _[ServiceExternalTrafficPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#serviceexternaltrafficpolicy-v1-core)_ | ExternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts, ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip |

Number must be in the range 1 to 65535. Name must be an IANA_SVC_NAME. If this is a string, it will be looked up as a named port in the target Pod's container ports. If this is not specified, the value of the 'port' field is used (an identity map). This field is ignored for services with clusterIP=None, and should be omitted or set equal to the 'port' field. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#defining-a-service |
| `nodePort` _integer_ | The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is NodePort or LoadBalancer. Usually assigned by the system. If a value is specified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the operation will fail. If not specified, a port will be allocated if this Service requires one. If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type from NodePort to ClusterIP).<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport<br /><br />Can only be specified if type is NodePort or LoadBalancer. |

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `minAvailable` _[IntOrString](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#intorstring-intstr-util)_ | An eviction is allowed if at least "minAvailable" pods selected by "selector" will still be available after the eviction, i.e. even in the absence of the evicted pod.  So for example you can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying "100%". |
| `maxUnavailable` _[IntOrString](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#intorstring-intstr-util)_ | An eviction is allowed if at most "maxUnavailable" pods selected by "selector" are unavailable after the eviction, i.e. even in absence of the evicted pod. For example, one can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying 0. This is a mutually exclusive setting with "minAvailable". |
| `unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy` _[UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicyType](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#unhealthypodevictionpolicytype-v1-policy)_ | UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy defines the criteria for when unhealthy pods should be considered for eviction. Current implementation considers healthy pods, as pods that have status.conditions item with type="Ready",status="True".<br /><br />Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow. If no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used, which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy.<br /><br />IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase="Running"), but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy). Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.<br /><br />AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase="Running"), but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective running pods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy. Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.<br /><br />Additional policies may be added in the future. Clients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy pods if they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.<br /><br />This field is beta-level. The eviction API uses this field when the feature gate PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy is enabled (enabled by default). |

#### GatewayConfigServiceOptions


GatewayConfigServiceOptions is used to includes options to customize the ingress service,
such as the annotations.



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` _[ServiceType](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#servicetype-v1-core)_ | Type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to `LoadBalancer`.<br /><br />`ClusterIP` allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.<br /><br />`NodePort` exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address, the same as if you had requested a Service of type: ClusterIP.<br /><br />`LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types |
| `name` _string_ | Name defines the name of the service. If Name is empty, the controller will generate a service name from the owning object. |

They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.<br /><br />More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations |
| `externalTrafficPolicy` _[ServiceExternalTrafficPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#serviceexternaltrafficpolicy-v1-core)_ | ExternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts, ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip |

For example, if the option for listener "http" specified the nodeport number to 30080,
The ingress service will expose the nodeport 30080 for the "http" listener of the Gateway.
For listeners without an item in listener options of GatewayConfiguration, default configuration is used for it.



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` _[SectionName](#sectionname)_ | Name is the name of the Listener. |
| `nodePort` _integer_ | The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is NodePort or LoadBalancer. Usually assigned by the system. If a value is specified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the operation will fail. If not specified, a port will be allocated if this Service requires one. If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type from NodePort to ClusterIP).<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport<br /><br />Can only be specified if type of the dataplane ingress service (specified in `spec.dataplaneOptions.network.services.ingress.type`) is NodePort or LoadBalancer. |

| `minAvailable` _[IntOrString](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#intorstring-intstr-util)_ | An eviction is allowed if at least "minAvailable" pods selected by "selector" will still be available after the eviction, i.e. even in the absence of the evicted pod.  So for example you can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying "100%". |
| `maxUnavailable` _[IntOrString](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#intorstring-intstr-util)_ | An eviction is allowed if at most "maxUnavailable" pods selected by "selector" are unavailable after the eviction, i.e. even in absence of the evicted pod. For example, one can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying 0. This is a mutually exclusive setting with "minAvailable". |
| `unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy` _[UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicyType](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#unhealthypodevictionpolicytype-v1-policy)_ | UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy defines the criteria for when unhealthy pods should be considered for eviction. Current implementation considers healthy pods, as pods that have status.conditions item with type="Ready",status="True".<br /><br />Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow. If no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used, which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy.<br /><br />IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase="Running"), but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy). Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.<br /><br />AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase="Running"), but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective running pods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy. Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.<br /><br />Additional policies may be added in the future. Clients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy pods if they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.<br /><br />This field is beta-level. The eviction API uses this field when the feature gate PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy is enabled (enabled by default). |

#### Promotion


Promotion is a type that contains fields that define how the operator handles
promotion of resources during a blue/green rollout.



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `strategy` _[PromotionStrategy](#promotionstrategy)_ | Strategy indicates how you want the operator to handle the promotion of the preview (green) resources (Deployments and Services) after all workflows and tests succeed, OR if you even want it to break before performing the promotion to allow manual inspection. |


_Appears in:_
- [BlueGreenStrategy](#bluegreenstrategy)

#### PromotionStrategy
_Underlying type:_ `string`

PromotionStrategy is the type of promotion strategy consts.<br /><br />Allowed values:<br /><br />  - `BreakBeforePromotion` is a promotion strategy which will ensure all new
    resources are ready and then break, to enable manual inspection.
    The user must indicate manually when they want the promotion to continue.
    That can be done by annotating the `DataPlane` object with
    `"gateway-operator.konghq.com/promote-when-ready": "true"`.





_Appears in:_
- [Promotion](#promotion)

#### Rollout


Rollout defines options for rollouts.



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `strategy` _[RolloutStrategy](#rolloutstrategy)_ | Strategy contains the deployment strategy for rollout. |

#### RolloutResourcePlan


RolloutResourcePlan is a type that holds rollout resource plan related fields
which control how the operator handles resources during and after a rollout.



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `deployment` _[RolloutResourcePlanDeployment](#rolloutresourceplandeployment)_ | Deployment describes how the operator manages Deployments during and after a rollout. |


_Appears in:_
- [RolloutResources](#rolloutresources)

#### RolloutResourcePlanDeployment
_Underlying type:_ `string`

RolloutResourcePlanDeployment is the type that holds the resource plan for
managing the Deployment objects during and after a rollout.<br /><br />Allowed values:<br /><br />  - `ScaleDownOnPromotionScaleUpOnRollout` is a rollout
    resource plan for Deployment which makes the operator scale down
    the Deployment to 0 when the rollout is not initiated by a spec change
    and then to scale it up when the rollout is initiated (the owner resource
    like a DataPlane is patched or updated).

#### RolloutResources


RolloutResources is the type which contains the fields which control how the operator
manages the resources it manages during or after the rollout concludes.

#### ServiceOptions


ServiceOptions is used to includes options to customize the ingress service,
such as the annotations.



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` _[ServiceType](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#servicetype-v1-core)_ | Type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to `LoadBalancer`.<br /><br />`ClusterIP` allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.<br /><br />`NodePort` exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address, the same as if you had requested a Service of type: ClusterIP.<br /><br />`LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types |
| `name` _string_ | Name defines the name of the service. If Name is empty, the controller will generate a service name from the owning object. |
| `annotations` _object (keys:string, values:string)_ | Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.<br /><br />More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations |
| `externalTrafficPolicy` _[ServiceExternalTrafficPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#serviceexternaltrafficpolicy-v1-core)_ | ExternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts, ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip |
