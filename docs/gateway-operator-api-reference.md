### <a id="github-com-kong-kong-operator-api-gateway-operator-v1alpha1-aigateway">AIGateway</a>


AIGateway is a network Gateway enabling access and management for AI &
Machine Learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM).<br /><br />The underlying technology for the AIGateway is the Kong Gateway configured
with a variety of plugins which provide the the AI featureset.<br /><br />This is a list of the plugins, which are available in Kong Gateway v3.6.x+:<br /><br />  - ai-proxy (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-proxy)
  - ai-request-transformer (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-request-transformer)
  - ai-response-transformers (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-response-transformer)
  - ai-prompt-template (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-template)
  - ai-prompt-guard-plugin (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-guard)
  - ai-prompt-decorator-plugin (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-decorator)<br /><br />So effectively the AIGateway resource provides a bespoke Gateway resource
(which it owns and manages) with the gateway, consumers and plugin
configurations automated and configurable via Kubernetes APIs.<br /><br />The current iteration only supports the proxy itself, but the API is being
built with room for future growth in several dimensions. For instance:<br /><br />  - Supporting auxiliary functions (e.g. decorator, guard, templater, token-rate-limit)
  - Supporting request/response transformers
  - Supporting more than just LLMs (e.g. CCNs, GANs, e.t.c.)
  - Supporting more hosting options for LLMs (e.g. self hosted)
  - Supporting more AI cloud providers
  - Supporting more AI cloud provider features<br /><br />The validation rules throughout are set up to ensure at least one
cloud-provider-based LLM is specified, but in the future when we have more
model types and more hosting options for those types so we may want to look
into using CEL validation to ensure that at least one model configuration is
provided. We may also want to use CEL to validate things like identifier
unique-ness, e.t.c.<br /><br />See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/

The LLM will dynamically answer questions and simulate a dialogue, while also keeping track of the conversation to provide contextually relevant responses.<br /><br />If "completions" is specified, prompts sent by the user will be stateless and "one-shot". The LLM will provide a single response to the prompt, without any context from previous prompts.<br /><br />If not specified, "completions" will be used as the default. |
| `defaultPrompts` _[LLMPrompt](#llmprompt) array_ | DefaultPrompts is a list of prompts that should be provided to the LLM by default. This is generally used to influence inference behavior, for instance by providing a "system" role prompt that instructs the LLM to take on a certain persona. |
| `defaultPromptParams` _[LLMPromptParams](#llmpromptparams)_ | DefaultPromptParams configures the parameters which will be sent with any and every inference request.<br /><br />If this is set, there is currently no way to override these parameters at the individual prompt level.

prompt to an LLM in order to influence its behavior and responses.<br /><br />For example, you might want to provide a "system" role and tell the LLM
something like "you are a helpful assistant who responds in the style of
Sherlock Holmes".



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `content` _string_ | Content is the prompt text sent for inference. |
| `role` _[LLMPromptRole](#llmpromptrole)_ | Role indicates the role of the prompt. This is used to identify the prompt's purpose, such as "system" or "user" and can influence the behavior of the LLM.<br /><br />If not specified, "user" will be used as the default. |

_Appears in:_
- [CloudHostedLargeLanguageModel](#cloudhostedlargelanguagemodel)

#### LLMPromptParams


LLMPromptParams contains parameters that can be used to control the behavior
of a large language model (LLM) when generating text based on a prompt.



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `temperature` _string_ | Temperature controls the randomness of predictions by scaling the logits before applying softmax. A lower temperature (e.g., 0.0 to 0.7) makes the model more confident in its predictions, leading to more repetitive and deterministic outputs. A higher temperature (e.g., 0.8 to 1.0) increases randomness, generating more diverse and creative outputs. At very high temperatures, the outputs may become nonsensical or highly unpredictable. |
| `maxTokens` _integer_ | Max Tokens specifies the maximum length of the model's output in terms of the number of tokens (words or pieces of words). This parameter limits the output's size, ensuring the model generates content within a manageable scope. A token can be a word or part of a word, depending on the model's tokenizer. |
| `topK` _integer_ | TopK sampling is a technique where the model's prediction is limited to the K most likely next tokens at each step of the generation process. The probability distribution is truncated to these top K tokens, and the next token is randomly sampled from this subset. This method helps in reducing the chance of selecting highly improbable tokens, making the text more coherent. A smaller K leads to more predictable text, while a larger K allows for more diversity but with an increased risk of incoherence. |
| `topP` _string_ | TopP (also known as nucleus sampling) is an alternative to top K sampling. Instead of selecting the top K tokens, top P sampling chooses from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold P. This method dynamically adjusts the number of tokens considered at each step, depending on their probability distribution. It helps in maintaining diversity while also avoiding very unlikely tokens. A higher P value increases diversity but can lead to less coherence, whereas a lower P value makes the model's outputs more focused and coherent. |

| `type` _[ServiceType](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#servicetype-v1-core)_ | Type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to `LoadBalancer`.<br /><br />`ClusterIP` allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.<br /><br />`NodePort` exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address, the same as if you had requested a Service of type: ClusterIP.<br /><br />`LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types |

If set to "Local", the proxy will configure the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip |

Number must be in the range 1 to 65535. Name must be an IANA_SVC_NAME. If this is a string, it will be looked up as a named port in the target Pod's container ports. If this is not specified, the value of the 'port' field is used (an identity map). This field is ignored for services with clusterIP=None, and should be omitted or set equal to the 'port' field. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#defining-a-service |
| `nodePort` _integer_ | The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is NodePort or LoadBalancer. Usually assigned by the system. If a value is specified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the operation will fail. If not specified, a port will be allocated if this Service requires one. If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type from NodePort to ClusterIP).<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport<br /><br />Can only be specified if type is NodePort or LoadBalancer. |

So for example you can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying "100%". |
| `maxUnavailable` _[IntOrString](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#intorstring-intstr-util)_ | An eviction is allowed if at most "maxUnavailable" pods selected by "selector" are unavailable after the eviction, i.e. even in absence of the evicted pod. For example, one can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying 0. This is a mutually exclusive setting with "minAvailable". |
| `unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy` _[UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicyType](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#unhealthypodevictionpolicytype-v1-policy)_ | UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy defines the criteria for when unhealthy pods should be considered for eviction. Current implementation considers healthy pods, as pods that have status.conditions item with type="Ready",status="True".<br /><br />Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow. If no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used, which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy.<br /><br />IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase="Running"), but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy). Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.<br /><br />AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase="Running"), but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective running pods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy. Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.<br /><br />Additional policies may be added in the future. Clients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy pods if they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.<br /><br />This field is beta-level. The eviction API uses this field when the feature gate PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy is enabled (enabled by default). |

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` _[ServiceType](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#servicetype-v1-core)_ | Type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to `LoadBalancer`.<br /><br />`ClusterIP` allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.<br /><br />`NodePort` exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address, the same as if you had requested a Service of type: ClusterIP.<br /><br />`LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types |
| `name` _string_ | Name defines the name of the service. If Name is empty, the controller will generate a service name from the owning object. |
| `annotations` _object (keys:string, values:string)_ | Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.<br /><br />More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations |
| `externalTrafficPolicy` _[ServiceExternalTrafficPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#serviceexternaltrafficpolicy-v1-core)_ | ExternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts, ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip |

Defaults to `LoadBalancer`.<br /><br />`ClusterIP` allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.<br /><br />`NodePort` exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address, the same as if you had requested a Service of type: ClusterIP.<br /><br />`LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types |
| `name` _string_ | Name defines the name of the service. If Name is empty, the controller will generate a service name from the owning object. |
| `annotations` _object (keys:string, values:string)_ | Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.<br /><br />More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations |
| `externalTrafficPolicy` _[ServiceExternalTrafficPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#serviceexternaltrafficpolicy-v1-core)_ | ExternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts, ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip |

#### GatewayConfigurationListenerOptions


GatewayConfigurationListenerOptions specifies configuration overrides of defaults on certain listener of the Gateway.
The name must match the name of a listener in the Gateway
and the options are applied to the configuration of the matching listener.
For example, if the option for listener "http" specified the nodeport number to 30080,
The ingress service will expose the nodeport 30080 for the "http" listener of the Gateway.
For listeners without an item in listener options of GatewayConfiguration, default configuration is used for it.



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` _[SectionName](#sectionname)_ | Name is the name of the Listener. |
| `nodePort` _integer_ | The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is NodePort or LoadBalancer. Usually assigned by the system. If a value is specified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the operation will fail. If not specified, a port will be allocated if this Service requires one. If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type from NodePort to ClusterIP).<br /><br />More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport<br /><br />Can only be specified if type of the dataplane ingress service (specified in `spec.dataplaneOptions.network.services.ingress.type`) is NodePort or LoadBalancer. |

It defaults to 1 pod.  minReplicas is allowed to be 0 if the alpha feature gate HPAScaleToZero is enabled and at least one Object or External metric is configured.  Scaling is active as long as at least one metric value is available. |
| `maxReplicas` _integer_ | maxReplicas is the upper limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale up. It cannot be less that minReplicas. |
| `metrics` _[MetricSpec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#metricspec-v2-autoscaling) array_ | metrics contains the specifications for which to use to calculate the desired replica count (the maximum replica count across all metrics will be used).  The desired replica count is calculated multiplying the ratio between the target value and the current value by the current number of pods.  Ergo, metrics used must decrease as the pod count is increased, and vice-versa.  See the individual metric source types for more information about how each type of metric must respond. If not set, the default metric will be set to 80% average CPU utilization. |
| `behavior` _[HorizontalPodAutoscalerBehavior](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#horizontalpodautoscalerbehavior-v2-autoscaling)_ | behavior configures the scaling behavior of the target in both Up and Down directions (scaleUp and scaleDown fields respectively). If not set, the default HPAScalingRules for scale up and scale down are used. |

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `minAvailable` _[IntOrString](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#intorstring-intstr-util)_ | An eviction is allowed if at least "minAvailable" pods selected by "selector" will still be available after the eviction, i.e. even in the absence of the evicted pod.  So for example you can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying "100%". |
| `maxUnavailable` _[IntOrString](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#intorstring-intstr-util)_ | An eviction is allowed if at most "maxUnavailable" pods selected by "selector" are unavailable after the eviction, i.e. even in absence of the evicted pod. For example, one can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying 0. This is a mutually exclusive setting with "minAvailable". |
| `unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy` _[UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicyType](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#unhealthypodevictionpolicytype-v1-policy)_ | UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy defines the criteria for when unhealthy pods should be considered for eviction. Current implementation considers healthy pods, as pods that have status.conditions item with type="Ready",status="True".<br /><br />Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow. If no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used, which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy.<br /><br />IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase="Running"), but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy). Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.<br /><br />AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase="Running"), but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective running pods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy. Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.<br /><br />Additional policies may be added in the future. Clients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy pods if they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.<br /><br />This field is beta-level. The eviction API uses this field when the feature gate PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy is enabled (enabled by default). |
