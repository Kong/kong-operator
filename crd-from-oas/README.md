## TODO

### TODOs

- Generated conversion functions unit tests have to check the actual conversion logic, not just the presence of the functions and that not error has been returned.

- Research feasibility of generating CRD validation tests from OAS spec. If feasible, implement it. If not, add scaoffolding generation which will require users to fill in the test cases manually.
