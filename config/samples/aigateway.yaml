# USAGE: take a copy of this manifest and then in your copy update the provided
# Secret to include your OpenAI API token and/or add tokens for other supported
# providers.
#
# Then `kubectl apply -f $manifest` the manifest and wait for the AIGateway to
# be fully deployed.
#
# FIXME: currently you'll need to find the Gateway resource that was created
# on behalf of the AIGateway to determine the address by which the Kong
# Gateway can be reached. In later iterations we'll have endpoints provided via
# the AIGateway resource status.
# See: https://github.com/kong/kong-operator/issues/137
#
# Once you have the endpoint, the path to your backends are based on the
# identifiers provided in the AIGateway below, and then you should be able to
# access them with curl or other tools, e.g.:
#
#   curl -X POST -d 'prompt=hi' https://${GATEWAY_ADDR}/devteam-chatgpt
#
# You can also modify the defaultPrompts in the examples below to change the
# overall behavior of the models on responses.
