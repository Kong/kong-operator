                      Mode selects how the operator adopts an already-existing entity (for example,
                      a Konnect resource) instead of creating a new one.

                      Supported values:
                      - "match": the operator retrieves the remote entity referenced by the
                        corresponding Adopt* options (for example, adopt.konnect.id) and performs a
                        field-by-field comparison against this CR's spec (ignoring server-assigned
                        metadata). If the specification matches the remote state, the operator
                        adopts the entity: it sets the status identifier and marks the resource as
                        ready/programmed without issuing any write operation to the remote system.
                        If the specification does not match the remote state, adoption fails: the
                        operator does not modify the remote entity and surfaces a failure
                        condition, allowing the user to align the spec with the existing entity if
                        adoption is desired.

                      - "override": the operator overrides the remote entity by the CR's spec.
                        If the entity with the ID and type exists, and it is not managed
                        by another CR (matching by the metadata.uid of the CR and the "k8s-uid"
                        label or tag of the Konnect entity), the operator updates the remote entity
                        by the CR's spec.
