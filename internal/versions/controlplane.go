// ManifestsVersionsForKICVersions is a map that explicitly sets which manifests version to use upon the KIC

// This data follows the semver constraint syntax (see https://github.com/Masterminds/semver#basic-comparisons)
// to set the range of KIC versions to be associated with a specific role version.
//
// e.g., for KIC with a version lower than "2.4", but greater or equal to "2.3", version "2.3" of the role is used.
//
// Whenever the KIC manifests are updated and released, that change should be reflected in this map,
// and the generators should be run again to produce the new cluster role and webhook config files.
//
// e.g., when in the future  KIC, and that update will be included in
// the release 5.0, a new entry '">=5.0": "5.0"' should be added to this map, and the previous most
// updated entry should be limited to "<5.0".
